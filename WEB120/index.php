 <p>Hi! I'm Mike, and I am currently enrolled in Seattle Central's Web Development Certificate program, and is interested in several avenues currently: Web,Database, and Software Development, as well as continuing learning skills for Project and Program Management.</p>
<p>I come from a game and web QA background, and have picked up elements of Project and Program Management over my career, but decided it was time to add a good dose of coding knowledge to my toolkit, which brings me to my current education adventure.</p>
 <p>When not pursuing day job or higher education elements, I am heavily involved in Seattle's local theater community. It pretty much takes up all my free time, between performing in them and regularly seeing over 100 performances a year. In addition to acting in several shows over the last decade, I've also found an artistic home at <a href="http://www.annextheatre.org/" target="_blank" title="Annex Theatre">Annex Theatre</a>, where I've been on the volunteer staff as the Bar Manager since 2010.  </p>

<p>I also perform as a regular cast member in <i>The Panel Jumper</i>, a webseries about comic book history and lore. I play the oft-beleaguered comic book store manager, Manager Mike.  You can check out Panel Jumper episodes at <a href="http://thepaneljumper.com/home/" target="_blank" title="The Panel Jumper webseries">www.thepaneljumper.com</a>.</p>
